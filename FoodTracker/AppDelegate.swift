// Initialize the app & respond to app-level events

import UIKit

// Create the **entry point** to your app & a **run loop** that delivers input events to your app
// == UIApplicationMain(AppDelegate)
// - Create an application object: responsible for managing the life cycle of the app
// - Create an instance of `AppDelegate` class, assign it to the application object
// - The system launche your app
@UIApplicationMain

// Define `AppDelegate` class
// - Create the window
// - Provide a place to respond to state transitions within the app
// - Adopt the `UIApplicationDelegate` protocal: define methods to set up the app, espond to the app's state changes,
// & handle app-level events
